# Game of Life Projects

Various attempts at building Conway's Game of Life in Processing, all of which failed.

**Interesting results:**
1) *Agario* slowly spreads and eats up everything in its path
2) *Cityscape* works by clicking, but creates a little "city" that looks kind of cool after a few clicks.

The "conwaysGameOfLife" folder has a working model, based off of these rules:
> 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under population. \s\s2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. \s\s3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation. \s\s4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
