# Game of Life Projects

Various attempts at building Conway's Game of Life in Processing, all of which failed.

**Interesting results:**
1) *Agario* slowly spreads and eats up everything in its path
2) *Cityscape* works by clicking, but creates a little "city" that looks kind of cool after a few clicks.

The "conwaysGameOfLife" folder has what's being worked on towards a working model.
